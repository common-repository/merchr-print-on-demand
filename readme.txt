3.	Create your Merchr account through the plugin and verify your email
4.	The API key will be automatically fetched from your Hub account so requires no input from you

= Where do you deliver? =

= How do payments work? =

When you make a sale, the full transaction amount will be processed through your existing WooCommerce payment gateway linked to your store (Stripe, PayPal, etc). You will then separately pay us the Cost & Shipping prices for the products that have been ordered. 

A payment method must be added for each store, or your balance topped up, before listing any products so that when a customer places an order you can cover the Product Cost. The Product Cost must be paid before the order is sent for printing.

#### For Pre-Paid Balance Top-Up ####

When logged in to the Merchr Hub, navigate to Payment > Payment Settings.
From here you can use a credit or debit card to top up your account balance.
Make sure you select ‘Account Balance’ as your default payment method.

#### For Pay-As-You-Go with a Stored Card ####
